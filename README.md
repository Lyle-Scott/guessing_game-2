I have created a game that prompts the user to guess my age and stores it as a variable called guess. I am 26 years old. It has a stored value called answer to represent my age. The next part of my code is an if/else statement that compares guess to answer. If guess is equal to answer then the user is told that they made the correct guess. If their guess is too high they are alerted that such and same for if their guess is too low.
